# PiDeck Current Architecture

> This document describes only what is implemented in the current repository, not a target architecture.
> For target plans and follow-ups, see the [product and technical plan](product-plan.en.md).

## 1. Product Boundary

PiDeck is a desktop adaptation layer for `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`: the Renderer handles interaction and presentation, while PiHost owns Pi Session, ModelRuntime, Agent, Tool, Provider, resources, and CLI compatibility capabilities.

PiDeck does not provide:

- A second agent, model catalog, credential store, or session database.
- Node.js, filesystem, Shell, or Pi SDK access from the Renderer side.

Provider API keys, OAuth, and other credentials remain stored by the Pi Runtime in the local Pi config directory.

## 2. Current Runtime Topology

```text
Sandboxed React Renderer
  └─ Preload: window.pideck
      └─ Electron Main
          ├─ BrowserWindow lifecycle
          ├─ IPC handler orchestration
          └─ child_process.fork(PiHost)
              └─ Electron bundled Node (ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE)
                  └─ @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent
```

The current implementation uses plain Node `child_process.fork` with `process.send/process.on("message")` — not Electron `utilityProcess`, not MessagePort. The fork targets the Electron executable itself with `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1`, i.e. Electron's bundled Node: when the bundled Node satisfies the Pi SDK engines there is no WebIDL/undici compatibility issue, and it reads the asar archive transparently, so node_modules are fully packed into the asar with only native `.node` modules and `apps/desktop/assets` unpacked via `asarUnpack`. If the bundled Node is below the Pi SDK requirement, an external system Node must be used with node_modules fully unpacked (a system Node cannot read asar).

The headless `pideck-cli` / `npm run cli -- <args>` entry follows a separate direct path: `packages/pi-host/dist/cli.js` loads the selected Pi SDK and calls Pi's official `main(args)`. Print, JSON, RPC, stdin JSONL, and Auth Print therefore retain Pi's own stdout/stderr and protocol semantics without entering the Renderer/Main IPC topology.

Two runtime resolution entry points:

- `PIDECK_NODE_EXECUTABLE`: explicitly sets the Node executable used by PiHost; defaults to `process.execPath` (Electron bundled Node).
- `PIDECK_PI_MODULE`: explicitly sets the Pi SDK entry file. Packaged builds otherwise require the lockfile-pinned SDK inside `app.asar`. Development resolves the repository's lockfile-pinned dependency before optionally falling back to a global Pi installation, preventing an unrelated older global CLI from silently changing the API surface.

`packages/pi-host` posts messages to both `process.send` and the `worker_threads` `parentPort`, so the process host can be swapped, but Main currently only uses `child_process.fork`.

### 2.1 Main

`apps/desktop/src/main/index.ts`

Main is only responsible for:

- Creating and destroying the BrowserWindow (`contextIsolation: true`, `nodeIntegration: false`, `sandbox: true`).
- Starting, listening to, and stopping PiHost. Lifecycle callbacks are bound to the process instance that emitted them, so a late `exit` from a replaced Host cannot tear down its replacement; restart resolves only after a real `runtime.status` IPC round trip.
- Resolving the operating-system proxy through an internal Main/PiHost bridge for each request URL when neither explicit proxy environment variables nor Pi `httpProxy` are set.
- Orchestrating between Renderer IPC and PiHost requests.
- Setting timeouts for requests (default 60s; `providers.login`, `sessions.share` 15min; `packages.*` 10min; `agent.prompt` and `input.externalEdit` unbounded because completion is externally/event driven) and handling Host disconnects.
- Opening protocol-validated HTTP(S) URLs in the system browser and rejecting in-window navigation.
- Recording project directory references, hidden references, and their display order in Electron `userData/projects.json`.
- Building the application menu and switching menu language via `app:set-language`; copy comes from `@pideck/i18n`.
- On Windows, Electron Window Controls Overlay keeps the themed Renderer surface behind the system controls. Edit/View/Help triggers follow the Workspace label and reuse the native application menu; below 1100px they collapse into one Menu button. At 560px and below, actions move to a second toolbar row to preserve the native 48px caption-control hit area. Settings drawers start below the complete toolbar (normally 48px, 96px in the narrow Windows layout). macOS keeps its system menu bar. `app:set-window-theme` synchronizes the native background/control-symbol colors with the Renderer theme.
- `app:popup-menu` is a trusted Main-only IPC endpoint, exposed as `PideckBridge.app.popupMenu({ menu, x, y })`. Its strict contract allows only all/edit/view/help and finite bounded CSS-pixel anchors. Main resolves the existing native menu by stable ID, scales/clamps coordinates to content bounds, and resolves after dismissal; Renderer never sends menu actions or executable templates. Pointer activation preserves edit selection; keyboard activation restores the previous content focus before opening and returns to the trigger on dismissal. Failures surface a localized retry/restart notice.
- Opening native dialogs for directory picking, session import, and external-editor application selection. Main validates a selected executable (or a macOS `.app`) and returns only a Pi-compatible command string; the Renderer never receives general filesystem access.
- Setting the Dock icon on macOS and attempting to load `pideck-miniwindow.node` for the minimized-window icon; failures degrade to a warning.

The project directory list stores only `cwd`, never Session or workspace content. Clicking a project in the Renderer expands its session list on demand via `sessions.list(cwd)`, keeping other projects' expansion states independent and leaving the central session untouched; only clicking a specific session switches the workspace. Every expanded group renders from its own `projectTasksByCwd[cwd]` cache, so the intermediate render of a cross-project switch cannot place the previous project's Sessions under the newly selected project. Right-click "remove" on a project only adds `cwd` to hidden references and never deletes project files or Pi Sessions. Main never creates `AgentSession`, never stores Provider credentials, and never executes user Shell commands.

### 2.2 Preload

`apps/desktop/src/preload/index.ts`

Preload exposes a capability-scoped `window.pideck` via `contextBridge`. The Renderer can only use the capabilities declared in contracts; it never gains access to the raw `ipcRenderer`, Node objects, or Credential objects.

### 2.3 PiHost

`packages/pi-host/src/index.ts`

PiHost is responsible for:

- Orchestrating `@pideck/pi-adapter`, SessionManager, AgentSession, and ModelRuntime.
- Resolving project Pi-resource access through Pi `ProjectTrustStore` and `hasTrustRequiringProjectResources()`, then constructing project `SettingsManager` and `ResourceLoader` instances with the effective saved, inherited, or default trust decision.
- Reading/restoring Pi Sessions, projecting the complete active `SessionManager.getBranch()` as the desktop transcript while leaving `AgentSession.messages` as Pi's compacted model context, and writing `pideck.execution-run` run metadata via `SessionManager.appendCustomEntry()`.
- Forwarding Agent events, Approval events, Auth events, and Extension UI requests. The orchestration entry remains in `index.ts`; process-local registries are isolated in `host-state.ts`, and Pi Agent event-to-bridge normalization is isolated in `agent-event-adapter.ts` so later domain splits can preserve the current IPC contract.
- Owning Pi `AgentSessionRuntime` so Extension commands receive RPC mode, official command-context actions, Session replacement/rebinding, diagnostics, async errors, shutdown requests, and cancellable/timeout-bound Extension UI requests.
- Executing Pi built-in tools, Bash, Provider login, Pi package management, permission-mode reads/writes, and session operations.
- Reading Pi's effective keybindings and invoking Pi's configured external-editor helper for the Renderer input adaptation; the Pi settings surface reads the effective command/source and writes the user command through Pi's locked `FileSettingsStorage`. Pi 0.84.4 splits editor commands on spaces before spawning, so on macOS/Linux PiHost temporarily replaces quoted selected absolute paths with no-space symlink aliases, calls the same Pi helper, then removes the aliases. The Renderer never spawns editors or reads Pi config files directly.
- Initializing Pi's own proxy-aware HTTP dispatcher before reporting `runtime.status=connected`, so OAuth token exchange, model requests, and Provider HTTP calls share the same PiHost route. Package-manager subprocesses such as npm, pnpm, and git retain their own proxy configuration.
- Converting cross-process data into JSON-serializable responses (`jsonSafe`) and keeping stable IDs plus queued image attachments in a PiHost sidecar so queue thumbnails, `promoteQueue`, `editQueue`, and `deleteQueue` can rebuild Pi's queue without dropping attachments.
- Scoping every in-memory SessionManager, AgentSession, queue, approval, and lifecycle resource by normalized `cwd` plus Pi session ID. Imported JSONL files may preserve the same ID in different projects, but deletion, abort, and queue operations remain project-isolated.
- Running Git workspace inspection and `gh` sharing commands asynchronously with bounded timeouts so external processes do not block the PiHost IPC loop.

Dynamic Pi SDK resolution, loading, model/Session adaptation, and guarded loading of Pi's version-matched keybinding, settings-storage, and external-editor modules live in `packages/pi-adapter`. Pi permission configuration, Extension UI binding, approval waiting, and policy switching live in `packages/permission-engine`. Neither creates a second agent, Provider, or Session store; the authoritative sources remain the Pi SDK and `@gotgenes/pi-permission-system`. The separate `packages/pi-host/src/cli.ts` is intentionally transparent and calls Pi's official `main()` rather than entering the desktop IPC protocol.

Proxy precedence is explicit `HTTP_PROXY` / `HTTPS_PROXY` / `NO_PROXY`, Pi's global `httpProxy` setting, then Electron's cross-platform system-proxy resolution. `pi-adapter` first calls Pi's version-matched `configureHttpDispatcher()`; only when no explicit/Pi proxy exists does it install a thin dispatcher that asks Main to run `session.resolveProxy(url)` for every request URL. PAC, bypass, and domain-specific rules therefore remain URL-aware instead of being flattened into a startup snapshot. Resolution failures reject the request rather than silently falling back to direct traffic. A missing or incompatible dispatcher fails PiHost startup with a sanitized `runtime.error` before process exit.

```

Each `packages/*` package currently has a single `src/index.ts` entry (`ui-system` uses `src/index.tsx`) with no deeper directory layering. They enforce code-boundary splits without introducing a second agent, permission, session, or credential system.

All Renderer presentation components live in `renderer/ui/`, re-exported through `ui/index.ts`; bounded streaming-delta batching lives in `use-stream-deltas.ts`. The single-file UI components and performance helpers of earlier versions have been replaced by these two structures; historical docs referencing old filenames should be corrected per this section.

## 4. Dependency Direction and Boundaries

```text
renderer → contracts + domain + i18n + ui-system
preload  → contracts
main     → contracts + i18n (menu copy); forks packages/pi-host/dist/index.js by path, never imports its modules
pi-host  → contracts + domain + pi-adapter + permission-engine
contracts → zod (strict runtime validation at the PiHost IPC boundary)
pi-adapter → Pi SDK (dynamic resolution, loading, public API adaptation only)
permission-engine → contracts + @gotgenes/pi-permission-system config
ui-system → React + focus-trap
```

`packages/contracts` provides both TypeScript declarations and executable validation. Its public types point at `src/index.ts`, while PiHost loads the compiled `dist/index.js`; the complete `PiHostCommand` schema map is implemented with strict Zod objects so unknown or coercible IPC values are rejected without maintaining a second handwritten schema language. Workspace typechecks and desktop development/production builds compile in the order `contracts → domain → pi-adapter → permission-engine → pi-host → i18n → ui-system`. Vite resolves `@pideck/ui-system` and `@pideck/i18n` directly to source and excludes them from dependency prebundling, so shared icon/component/label changes hot-reload without a stale `dist` or browser prebundle. Vite still transforms this source into JavaScript for development and production; PiHost loads compiled workspace packages.

Must be observed:

- The Renderer must not import the Pi SDK, Node builtins, or credential objects.
- Main must not create `AgentSession` directly.
- PiHost is currently the only code boundary allowed to depend on the Pi SDK.
- Cross-process messages carry only JSON/structured-clone serializable data.
- New IPC must update `packages/contracts` first, then Main, Preload, and Renderer.
- Pi fallback capabilities must live outside UI components and state that the Pi CLI/SDK remains the authoritative source.

Renderer image previews remain a non-authoritative cache. `image-cache.ts` uses the small `idb` Promise wrapper while preserving the existing `pideck-cache` database, `snapshots` object store, structured-clone values, and `localStorage` fallback. Shared modal focus behavior is implemented once in `ui-system` over `focus-trap`; PiDeck retains its own dialog markup and inert application-shell boundary, while the library owns nested trap stacking, dynamic tabbable discovery, Escape routing, and focus restoration.

Searchable action selection uses `cmdk` for the Pi commands subpage in Quick settings and the Composer model chooser, so filtering, active-option semantics, arrow-key navigation, scrolling, and Enter activation share one tested interaction primitive. PiDeck still owns Pi command routing and model selection side effects. Plain filters that do not select an action use native Chromium search inputs, and transcript search remains Session-data-aware because browser page search cannot see folded, unmounted history.

PiHost restores the desktop transcript by projecting every entry on Pi's complete active `SessionManager.getBranch()`. It deliberately does not expose `AgentSession.messages` as history because that array is the compaction-aware model context and omits the summarized prefix after a restart. Context compaction therefore remains effective for subsequent model requests without hiding persisted pre-compaction turns from the user.

The Renderer session timeline is composed of `app-conversation.tsx` and `ui/message-timeline.tsx` as a **plain document-flow list with earlier-message folding** — no virtual list. Consecutive Assistant commentary records inside one turn retain unique React identities and use a shared three-level rhythm for turn, continuation, and section spacing through the transition into live Activity, while the final record alone reuses the live response key. During a run, the execution summary is a non-interactive elapsed-time indicator while `ui/live-activity.tsx` renders normalized thinking blocks and tool calls in their actual chronological order as a low-emphasis inline flow rather than a separate raised card. After settlement, the live panel retracts and the complete process moves into the expandable summary. Both live and completed process regions have the same bounded viewport-relative height and scroll internally on overflow; while the live region is following, `ActivityStep` refreshes and late Markdown/diagram resizes keep its inner viewport pinned to the newest output, an intentional upward wheel/touch gesture pauses that follow, and returning to the inner bottom resumes it. These process regions are marked as nested scroll islands, so their wheel/touch/captured-scroll events never change the outer transcript follow state or show its "jump to latest" control. Tool arguments/results stay collapsed per call, and excessive provider blank lines are compacted for presentation only. Because Mermaid, KaTeX, and syntax highlighting are asynchronously sized, the measure-position loop of virtual lists is fundamentally incompatible with them (jumping, overlap, rubber-banding); instead only the most recent `FOLD_WINDOW = 200` messages stay mounted, with older messages folded behind a "show earlier" button revealing `FOLD_STEP = 200` at a time. Anti-jump relies on native scroll anchoring: `.conversation-scroll` must keep `overflow-anchor: auto` (the virtual-list-era `none` disables that mechanism).

Per-run change review is owned by PiHost plus `session-change-review.ts` and `session-change-review-store.ts`. At `agent_start`, PiHost captures the current Git worktree baseline without changing the user's index; a non-Steering Follow-up closes the previous segment and reuses the same boundary inspection as the next baseline, while Steering remains in the active segment. Known mutating tool completions (edit, write, Bash, and PowerShell) schedule one debounced, supersedable preview; settlement performs the authoritative comparison, including workspace changes made by other processes during the same interval. Candidate paths, retained baseline bytes, per-file/total patches, generated files, and Git duration are hard-capped. Rename, executable-mode, binary, oversized, committed-HEAD, and truncated states are represented explicitly.

Completed reviews no longer append full patches indefinitely to Session JSONL. PiHost writes one small versioned `pideck.change-review-store` custom-entry anchor and atomically replaces a sidecar beside the Pi Session file. The sidecar retains at most 20 reviews and 12 MB, is copied beside JSONL exports/imports, and is removed with the Session. The latest valid legacy `pideck.change-review` records are copied into the sidecar on the next write; their original append-only JSONL entries remain untouched for compatibility, but no new full-patch entries are appended. Every legacy/imported/sidecar record is schema-, path-, count-, and byte-validated; invalid sidecars are quarantined. `sessions.changeReviews` returns summary-only records plus Git availability, while `sessions.changeReview` lazily returns the selected bounded patch detail, preventing a 20-run patch snapshot from crossing IPC on every Session switch. PiHost tracks final write promises, serializes sidecar mutations, and the graceful `runtime.shutdown` handshake waits briefly before Main terminates the Host.

`ui/change-review.tsx` opens from the Composer summary as a wide split pane or focus-trapped overlay drawer whose title bar, project sidebar, dividers, and covered conversation are inert. It provides the rounded run picker, filtered/aggregated directory tree with full arrow-key navigation, unified or Codex-style split diff, line wrapping, whitespace-only filtering, lightweight syntax highlighting, hunk navigation, incremental row folding, path copy, precise file/global truncation messages, and actionable non-Git/Git/storage/detail-load retry states. Review open/run/file/tree/split/options/scroll state is bounded and persisted per Session by `use-change-review.ts`; patches remain Host-owned. A newly queued empty Follow-up cannot hide the newest non-empty summary. The UI labels the result as interval worktree changes because concurrent external edits cannot be attributed exclusively to Pi. Staging, reverting, committing, and editable merge actions remain outside this read-only review mapping.

Each visited Session keeps its own pane; inactive panes use `visibility: hidden` instead of `display: none`, so the browser naturally preserves each pane's `scrollTop` without manual restore logic, while their scroll/resize/mutation observers are disconnected until the pane is active again. The `ConversationScrollSnapshot` is only `{ top, follow }`. Leaving follow is driven **only by real input gestures** (`wheel` with `deltaY < 0`, or an upward touch drag) — never by inferring direction from a shrinking `scrollTop`, because content legitimately shrinks (a live row replaced by the final message, the working indicator disappearing, an execution summary collapsing) and a delta-based guess misreads that as "user scrolled up", killing auto-follow mid-stream. During programmatic smooth scrolling, `pinningRef` (with a 1000ms timeout safety valve) latches follow so the "jump to latest" button does not flash back mid-animation. Modal overlays mark the application shell inert/hidden from assistive technology, and the shared focus primitive lets only the topmost nested dialog handle Escape.

PiDeck's Renderer `activity`/`completedActivity` remains presentation state of the current process and is never written back into the Session. To restore "processed" durations reliably, PiHost records each execution group's `startedAt/endedAt/durationMs` at `agent_start`, non-Steering Follow-up boundaries, and `agent_settled`, writing them as a `pideck.execution-run` custom entry via Pi's official `SessionManager.appendCustomEntry()`; the entry never enters the LLM context. The Renderer reads exact durations through `sessions.runMetadata`; Pi's raw thinking/tool content is used only to rebuild step content. Old sessions without this metadata show "processed" but never infer durations from message timestamps.

### Desktop parity adapters

`pi-command-arguments.ts` resolves exact runtime model IDs and export filenames. `sessions.export` accepts an optional output path: Main validates it, resolves project-relative/`~/` paths, and obtains native save/overwrite confirmation before PiHost calls Pi's exporter. A cancelled picker returns `null`. `.jsonl` paths select JSONL, and other paths select HTML.

`settings-command-handler.ts` reads advanced effective settings through Pi's getters and writes only changed retry/compaction/proxy/timeout/default-tool keys through `FileSettingsStorage.withLock`, preserving nested provider retry policy and unknown settings. Existing proxy credentials are stripped from the summary and preserved unless explicitly replaced. HTTP proxy/idle timeout apply after a Host/application restart; default tools apply to newly created sessions.

`extensions.syncEditor` / `extensions.invokeShortcut` map to `extension.editor.sync` / `extension.shortcut.invoke`. Both validate project scope and bounded text. The former updates a project/session-scoped presentation mirror without creating an Agent; the latter re-resolves Pi `ExtensionRunner.getShortcuts()` against effective keybindings, flushes the supplied draft, and calls the real handler with `createContext()`. `SessionCapabilities.extensionShortcuts` contains only key/description DTOs. `use-extension-editor.ts` blocks dispatch during IME composition, repeated keydown, concurrent handlers, and modal dialogs. Live text is an asynchronous desktop mirror, not a synchronous cross-process TUI component.

`extension-theme.ts` in PiHost retains actual SDK Theme objects and resource-loaded themes. Pi's version-matched theme companion module is capability-guarded by `pi-adapter`. A stable proxy preserves `ui.theme` after SDK context copying. Theme events are `extension.ui.presentation` with `action: "theme"` and an `ExtensionThemeSnapshot`: only hex colors and a light/dark appearance cross IPC. Renderer validates a fixed token allowlist and applies it to the active Session's shell and overlays. TUI factories remain explicitly unsupported and are never invoked or serialized.

Manual compaction Stop renders from `isSending || isCompacting`, calls `abortCompaction()` before `abort()`, and transfers staged messages back to native Pi queues without starting them after cancellation/failure. Their IDs, order, text, and images are preserved. Manual compaction and interactive Extension shortcuts are event-driven requests without the default 60-second timeout; process disconnect still rejects pending requests.

After a Host restart, a session operation resolves its persisted ID through Pi `SessionManager.list(cwd)` if the path cache is cold. Unknown IDs fail explicitly instead of silently creating an empty session. Runtime smoke exercises this before any session-list request.

## 5. Current Bridge Capabilities

Per `PideckBridge` in `packages/contracts/src/index.ts`, currently declared:

- `app.setLanguage/setWindowTheme/quit`
- `runtime.status`
- `projects.list/chooseDirectory/remove/trustStatus/setTrust`
- `sessions.list/create/delete/remove/messages/runMetadata/changeReviews/changeReview/capabilities/compact/export/import/rename/generateTitle/stats/share/changelog`
- `models.list/refresh`
- `workspace.snapshot`
- `input.keybindings/externalEdit`
- `providers.list/login/cancelLogin/logout/setApiKey/resolveAuth/openAuthUrl`
- `agent.prompt/executeBash/abort/setThinkingLevel/setModel/cycleModel/setScopedModels/queue/setQueueModes/clearQueue/promoteQueue/editQueue/deleteQueue`
- `sessions.compact/reload`, `settings.get/update/chooseExternalEditor`, `extensions.resolveUi/syncEditor/invokeShortcut`
- `packages.list/install/remove/update/configure/configureResource/checkUpdates`
- `approvals.resolve`
- `permissions.status/setMode`

Every invoke handler validates that the caller is the active PiDeck window's main frame. Project-scoped calls accept only directories already recorded in Electron's project registry; new directories enter that registry only through the native directory picker. Session import likewise always obtains its JSONL path from Electron's native file picker—the Renderer cannot provide an arbitrary filesystem path.
- `events.subscribe`

Three naming relationships need attention:

- `sessions.remove` is an alias of `sessions.delete`; both go through the same `sessions:delete` IPC channel.
- `providers.resolveAuth` / `providers.cancelLogin` / `providers.openAuthUrl` correspond to IPC channels `providers:auth-response` / `providers:cancel-login` / `providers:open-auth-url`; the first two are forwarded to PiHost commands `providers.auth-response` / `providers.cancelLogin`, while the last is opened by Main directly in the system browser.
- `sessions.changelog` maps to the PiHost command `app.changelog`; `projects.list/chooseDirectory/remove` are composed by Main from `projects.json` plus the PiHost `projects.list` and `sessions.list` commands, with no one-to-one Host command. `projects.trustStatus/setTrust` map to PiHost's Pi `ProjectTrustStore`; PiHost derives the effective saved, inherited, or default decision and passes it to every project `SettingsManager` and `ResourceLoader` construction.

If the docs disagree with `packages/contracts`, contracts and the implementation win; the docs must be updated in the same change.

## 6. Current Event Flow

`PiDeckRuntimeEvent` declares the types `runtime.status`, `runtime.error`, `agent.event`, `auth.event`, `approval.requested`, `approval.resolved`, `extension.ui.request`, `extension.ui.notify`.

Six message shapes are currently dispatched with a top-level `type`:

```ts
{ type: "runtime.status", payload: "connected" | "starting" | "disconnected" }
{ type: "runtime.error", payload: { message: string } }
{ type: "agent.event", taskId, event }
{ type: "approval.requested", taskId, requestId, event: { toolName, args } }
{ type: "auth.event", requestId, event }
{ type: "extension.ui.request", taskId, requestId, event: ExtensionUiRequest }
```

`approval.resolved` and `extension.ui.notify` are emitted by `packages/permission-engine` through PiHost's `emit()`, so when they reach the Renderer they are wrapped in `agent.event` under `event.type` rather than at the top level. `approval.resolved` is only produced when switching permission modes auto-approves or denies a pending approval; the approval card is then cleared locally by the Renderer after `permissions.setMode` succeeds. The `approval.resolved` branch matched by top-level `type` in `use-runtime-events.ts` currently never hits; making top-level events work requires posting directly from PiHost and updating this section in the same change.

`runtime.status` is published by Main: `connected` when PiHost reports it, `starting` during process startup, `disconnected` at process exit with all pending requests rejected.

Auth prompts come back through `providers.resolveAuth` (IPC `providers:auth-response`) as text, options, or a cancel state; cancelling ends Pi's wait without leaving a pending login request, and PiHost also propagates Pi's per-prompt abort signal so SDK-cancelled fallback prompts do not leave stale waiters. Each Renderer OAuth attempt carries an opaque operation ID. Closing Provider settings calls `providers.cancelLogin`, and PiHost aborts that operation through Pi's `AuthInteraction.signal`; starting another attempt for the same Provider also supersedes any stale operation before invoking `ModelRuntime.login()`. For the version-guarded Pi 0.84.2–0.84.4 OpenAI Codex browser flow, PiHost probes the SDK's fixed loopback listener endpoint before resolving the browser-method prompt. A failed probe keeps that prompt active so the Renderer can show an actionable error and the user can choose Pi's device-code method. The SDK's concurrent manual-code prompt stays a secondary fallback while the loopback callback is pending, and Main restores/focuses the PiDeck window after `providers.login` succeeds.

`agent.event` currently covers agent start/end, agent settled, turn start/end, message start/update/end/snapshot, tool execution start/update/end, queue update, and Pi 0.84.4 `ui_prompt_start` / `ui_prompt_end` events. The new Extension UI lifecycle events are explicitly normalized into serializable `{ type, reason, kind, title? }` payloads; the existing `extension.ui.request` bridge still owns actual desktop prompt input. Queue updates are normalized into stable-ID entries with text and serializable image payloads; clear-and-rebuild mutations suppress intermediate empty/partial updates and publish one authoritative result. The `messages` of `agent_end` come from the Pi SDK, so the Renderer can merge the round's messages before any automatic retry or queue continuation; `agent_settled` then reads the final Session snapshot. The Renderer only consumes serializable normalized objects, never `AgentSession` instances.

## 7. Pi Capability Mapping

- Pi Session / `cwd` → left project tree, per-project session lists, and the central conversation.
- Pi ModelRuntime → Provider settings, model selection, and thinking level.
- Pi slash command / Prompt / Skill catalog → Composer suggestions and the searchable Pi commands subpage in Quick settings.
- Pi Agent event → streaming replies, tool process, approvals, and run status.
- Pi Session export/compact → session operations in Quick settings; Session Tree `/fork`, `/clone`, `/tree` remain on the to-support list.
- Pi Agent steering/follow-up queue → compact Composer-attached queue stack, delivery mode, batch mode, images, promotion, editing, and deletion. Automatic compaction routes input through Pi's native queues; manual compaction uses a scoped Host staging queue because it ends without an active Agent run, then starts the first staged prompt and transfers the rest back to Pi in order. The same stable-ID mutation surface covers both queues, and preflight reservations prevent competing direct prompts.
- Pi Package management → Pi packages settings panel in Quick settings.
- The header gear / `Ctrl/Cmd + ,` opens the compact Quick settings root; task actions and Pi commands are drill-down pages, while `Ctrl/Cmd + K` opens the Pi commands page directly. The former header Provider and standalone command launchers are removed. All settings drawers are anchored below `--titlebar-height` on macOS and Windows.
- The Pi commands subpage dispatches click/Enter through `palette-command.ts`: built-ins call existing desktop handlers, runtime-tagged `source: "extension"` commands call Pi's prompt bridge, and Prompt/Skill resources remain editable templates. Fixed actions filter their equivalent slash commands to avoid duplicate rows. The optional source metadata is additive to `SessionCapabilities`; no new IPC endpoint is introduced. Dialog focus restoration uses a shared workspace-origin context when the launcher has already unmounted.
- Pi permission system modes → permission-level control below the input.
- Pi workspace file list → `@file` reference candidates in the Composer. `workspace.snapshot` also returns git `changes`, but the current UI has no standalone Files/Changes panel, so the field is not yet consumed.

Capabilities without a stable Bridge or UI must be shown as unimplemented, never faked as successful. PiDeck does not maintain a separate Pi CLI execution panel.

## 8. Packaging and Distribution

Local packaging keeps the current-host `package:mac` command and exposes explicit `package:mac:arm64`, `package:mac:x64`, and `package:win:x64` commands for matching native runners. Installer filenames include the operating system and architecture; package verification checks the asar runtime entries, PiDeck notices, Electron/Chromium runtime licenses, and denylist after each build. Native packaging jobs then start PiHost from the packaged `app.asar`, call `runtime.status`, and verify through `app.info` that the bundled Pi SDK matches the locked version.

`.github/workflows/release.yml` starts on a matching version tag (or a manual rebuild of an existing tag), requires the tag commit to be contained in `main`, pins that commit SHA, rejects tags that differ from `package.json`, reruns dependency-notice/lint/typecheck/test/build checks, and packages Windows x64, macOS arm64, and macOS x64 separately. Each native job inventories its final `app.asar` into a platform-specific CycloneDX SBOM. The final job generates `SHA256SUMS.txt`, creates GitHub provenance attestations, and creates or updates a draft GitHub Release.

The native packaging jobs run through the protected `release-signing` Environment and expose certificate material only to their `electron-builder` step. macOS hardened runtime, entitlements, and notarization are enabled when the corresponding signing and Apple API secrets are present; Windows Authenticode uses its own certificate secrets. Without trusted certificates the workflow remains useful for test installers, but those artifacts are not suitable as trusted public releases.

## 9. Runtime Verification

For desktop parity, additionally verify advanced settings round-trip/validation and unchanged proxy credentials; `/model provider/model` including late Extension registration; native-confirmed HTML/JSONL export paths with spaces and picker cancellation; manual compaction Stop with staged text/images and no automatic continuation; registered shortcut conflict/modal/IME handling; scoped editor text; Pi theme lookup/selection and Session isolation; actionable TUI compatibility notices. UI checks use an isolated agent directory and Electron profile, with no external model prompts.

For Windows menu changes, verify `app:popup-menu` through the Preload bridge: all three groups and the compact menu, pointer/keyboard dismissal, copy/paste with an existing text selection, zoom-adjusted anchors, localization, packaged-only restrictions, and rejection of unknown groups or malformed coordinates. Check 375/560/760/1024/1440px layouts and caption-button clearance; macOS must not render duplicate title-bar menus. These desktop menus do not call PiHost.

After changing PiHost, contracts, Main, Preload, or Provider/Session-related capabilities, at minimum execute:

```text
runtime.status
projects.list
models.list
providers.list
sessions.create
sessions.runMetadata
sessions.changeReviews
sessions.changeReview (missing ID returns null)
sessions.capabilities
  # Verify registered Extension commands carry source: "extension".
agent.cycleModel
agent.queue
agent.deleteQueue (missing stable ID must fail without mutation)
workspace.snapshot
```

And run:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run test:renderer
npm run build
```

`npm run test:renderer` first runs `prebuild` to compile all workspace packages, then runs the structural renderer guards and behavior-level security/concurrency regressions in `apps/desktop/scripts/*.test.cjs` with `node --test`.
